# Projects


### Simple Bytecode Instrumentation

Add code to each loop iteration and each method call that check a flag and
throws an exception if a "cancelled" flag (or Thread.isInterrupted())
has been set.

### Javadoc Doclet

* Should output documentation as JSON and/or dumped to a database, instead of
  generating static HTML
* Perhaps also attach the docs as (keep-at-runtime) annotations directly in the
  bytecode
* For use with hover help / help while editing code

### WebGL graphics

Graphics output with WebGL instead of SVG

### Row of buttons to insert commonly used language constructs

### Documentation popup for language constructs

### Exercises

* System for organising exercises, displaying exercise text and sample code
* Switching between different exercises, and exercises/projects (i.e., saving
  code, screen layout etc)
* Testing
* Tracking progress

### Projects

* Grouping code/files in projects, storing screen layout between project
  sessions

### Object Display

* Draw representations of objects
* Allow interactions (calling methods, for example) and "use in console"
* At least for objects stored as variables, maybe also useful to show accessible
  objects in memory (e.g. visualising lists and so on)

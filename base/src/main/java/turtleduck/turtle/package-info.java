 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle graphics</a>
 * is a simple way to produce graphics, often used in educational settings.
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>It's an easy way for beginners to create nice graphics
 * <li>It's a convenient way for experienced programmers to create vector
 * (scalable) graphics
 * <li>It's a great way to learn about …
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>programming</em>, since you must learn to decompose your drawing into
 * step-by-step drawing instructions
 * <li><em>abstraction</em>, as you learn to use methods to compose simpler
 * drawings into more complex ones
 * <li><em>object orientation</em>; since you must learn to see the world from
 * the turtle's perspective in order to direct it effectively
 * <li><em>drawing and colours</em>, and how that works on a computer
 * <li><em>robotics</em>, if you use or build your own robotic turtle to make
 * physical drawings
 * <li><em>geometry</em>, since you'll work with coordinates and angles
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A <em>turtle</em> has a pen, a position and a heading. It can move with its
 * pen up or down; if the pen is down it'll trace a line behind it as it moves.
 * The turtle is controlled by giving it instructions such as “move forward 10”
 * or “turn left 45°”; all instructions are interpreted relative to the turtle's
 * own frame of reference (its position and heading).

 * This library supports <em>turtleducks</em>, with some extra functionality compared to classic turtle graphics:
